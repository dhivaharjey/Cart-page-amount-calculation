## React Vite

- Step 1: Create a new Vite project
  To create a new Vite project, open your terminal and run the following command:

- `npx create-vite your-project-name --template react`
- Replace your-project-name with the name you want for your project. Vite supports many frameworks, but in this case, we specify the react template with the --template react option.

- Step 2: Navigate to the project directory
  Once the Vite project is created, navigate to the project directory:

- `cd your-project-name`
- Donâ€™t forget to replace your-project-name with the actual name you chose for your project (unless of course, you want to keep this name for your project).

- Step 3: Install dependencies and run the development server
  Next, install the necessary dependencies and start the development server:

- `npm run devi`

- `cd your-project-name`
- `npm i`
- `npm run dev`
- After running these commands, you should see a message in your terminal indicating that your React website is running on a specific port, itâ€™s usually a â€˜randomâ€™ port number like `http://localhost:5173.`

Now, open your browser and visit the provided URL to see your React website in action.
